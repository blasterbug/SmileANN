\section{Difficulties and improvements}

\paragraph{Difficulties}{
    The main difficulties faced during the development was a stupid error fixed
 during the last hours. I forgot, in the activation function to initiate the
 sum of the inputs and then I overide it rather than adding it to previous
 computation.
}

\paragraph{Improvements}{
    There are different way to improve the program, and in particular, the 
 recognition process. the first one could be turning all the images in the same
 direction before using it as the inputs of the network. A other way could be
 increasing or decreasing pixels values to emphasize the faces on it.

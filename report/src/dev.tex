\section{Faces recognition process}

    \paragraph{}{
        To recognise each faces, I use a perceptron trained to recognize a 
     specific face. So I have four neurons: One to reconigze happy faces, one to
     recognize sad faces and so on.

    \subsection{Perceptrons}

    \paragraph{}{
        A perceptron, or a neuron, is basically a function encapsulate in a 
     cell. The cell has inputs, the synapses. Each synapse has a weight. To
     activate the neuron, the neuron use his activation function. The activation
     function is the sum of all inputs, regarding the weights of each inputs.
     Then to adjust the activation level, the add a bias, which is a special
     input always at $1$ but with a weight. Then we use the \texttt{sigmoid}
     \footnote{ the \texttt{sigmoid} function is define by $sigmoid(t) = 
     \frac{1}{1 + e^{-t}}$} function to activate the neuron with the previous 
     sum as the input. The ouput level is borned between $0$ and $1$. And the
     neuron is activated when his ouput is \textit{close} to $1$.

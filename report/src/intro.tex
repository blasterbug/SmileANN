        The purpose for this second assignment is to build a neural network in
     order to recognize four differents face expressions : happy, sad, mad and 
     mischievous. So this report deals with how I implemented artifical neurons
     based on the model introduced during the lecture and then I explain how I 
     use it to recognize faces. Roughly, the report is divided in two parts. 
     In the first one is about how the artificial neural network works. The
     second one is about the issues faced during the development and the 
     possible improvements to increase the network performance. \newline
     I don't deal with the way I open files and how I read data from it. The 
     whole source code for the program and the modules I created are available 
     in the appedix \ref{app:neuron} and \ref{app:faces}.
